# BitbucketRepo-iOS
A sample iOS app to list public repositories of Bitbucket and display the detail on clicking the row.

### 🌟 Implement Me:
- When user scrolls to the bottom, load more content by using `fetchMore()` if there is a next page and while fetching the loading indicator should be displayed at the bottom of the tableview.
- Add pull-to-refresh function into table view.

### 🐞 Fix Me:
 - The detail view doesn't seem to display correct data, please fix it.
 - There are leaks in these classes, please identify and resolve them and make sure all the DEINIT get printed.
 - Resolve the constraint warning in the detail view.

### ⚙️ Write Test Codes:
 - To validate parsing the model.
 - To check if the view model fetch data properly.

### 👨🏻‍💻 Opinion:
 - What do you think about this ViewModel?


### Note: Do not remove `sleep(2)` statement, it's for simulating network latency.
